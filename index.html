      Created with heavy influence from PrettyCoffee's "Yet another generic startpage", which can be found at https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage.
      This project was an attempt to make my own startpage roughly based off his startpage which I used for several weeks but did not feel the style fit my liking.
      This project is made in a similar style while providing unique changes I felt would be more adapted to my needs (such as the clock).
      The original project was made to showcase his react library, "startpage", which was made with TypeScript. This project was not made with his library as it was not a recreation but a project with influence. However his library is very useful and can be found at https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/startpage.
      The art used in the startpage was made by Motocross Saito, a digital artist of pixelated GIF animations who's drawings attempt to â€œexpress a feeling that can soothe your mind, create a calming effect". His work can be found at https://motocross-arts.tumblr.com/ or on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/moot_sai/.
      The music used in this project is "Reflections" by Toshifumi Hinata. It is a Contemporary Classical piece released in 1986. His work can be found at https://open.spotify.com/artist/08tfDO4dSrwxax35a3HIMC.
