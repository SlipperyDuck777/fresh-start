# Fresh Start

Fresh Start is a startpage Created with heavy influence from a project by PrettyCoffee; [yet-another-generic-startpage](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage).  This project was an attempt to make my own startpage roughly based off his startpage which I used for several weeks but did not feel the style fit my liking.  The original project was made to showcase his react library, [startpage](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/startpage), which was made with TypeScript. The art used in the startpage was made by Motocross Saito, a digital artist of pixelated GIF animations who's drawings attempt to â€œexpress a feeling that can soothe your mind, create a calming effect". His work can be found on [Tumblr](https://motocross-arts.tumblr.com/) or on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/moot_sai/). The music used in this project is "Reflections" by Toshifumi Hinata. It is a Contemporary Classical piece released in 1986. His work can be found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/08tfDO4dSrwxax35a3HIMC).

## Installation

To install Fresh Start, simply download the repository files anywhere on your computer, which the browser has access to. 

Alternatively, you can use git-clone:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/SlipperyDuck777/fresh-start.git
```

## Usage

1. Download extension that redirects your new tab ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/))
2. Set the path of `index.html` where you chose to download the repository into the URL field of the extension settings. Alternatively you can set the URL field to the following if you would not like to host the files from your computer: https://slipperyduck777.github.io/fresh-start/. Unfortunately you need to host the files locally to save your customizations, as the feature to do so is a work in progress and is not expected to be implemented in the near future.
4. If properly configured, you should see Fresh Start every time you open a new tab. If the browser does not display Fresh Start you must tweak your browsers settings to display the previously specified path when opening a new instance.
